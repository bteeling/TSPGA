# TSPGA
Traveling Salesman Genetic Algorithm
This program uses a genetic algorithm to generate optimal or near-optimal solutions for a Traveling Salesman Problem (given n cities, find the shortest round trip path through them). The program can also be used to generate a bell curve for multiple runs with the same city data.
Classes written by me:
TSPGA.java (main class)
Member.java
City.java
The rest of the classes were not written by me, but are needed for the program to run
