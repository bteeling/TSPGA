# TSPGA
Traveling Salesman Genetic Algorithm
This program uses a genetic algorithm to generate optimal or near-optimal solutions for a Traveling Salesman Problem (given n cities, find the shortest round trip path through them). The program can also be used to generate a bell curve for multiple runs with the same city data.
